# Treehouse Responsive Layout

# Project Overview

In this project you'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The design should respond to small, medium, and large viewport sizes and devices; and demonstrate an understanding of responsive design.

You will write basic layout styles to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.

# Instructions

1. Create index.html and styles.css files.

2. Link the styles.css file to the index.html file.

3. Look at the provided mockups and add the same header, titles, content and footer information into your index.html file.

4. Link your navigation menu to the correct sections of the page using IDâ€™s to link to anchor tags.

5. Use appropriate HTML markup for each piece of content.

6. Use the images provided for the portfolio images.

7. Provide an image for your about picture to reflect the placement and sizing in the mockup.

8. Create a mobile first design

   - Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".
   - Use CSS to style your portfolio to look like the ones in the mockup.
   - Make sure your mobile design matches the mockup at 320px screen sizes.

9. Add media queries to create a responsive style that matches the styles and two breakpoints provided in the mockups.
   - Match the design as it should look on a tablet device that's at least 768 pixels wide and a desktop screen size that is at least 1024px wide.
